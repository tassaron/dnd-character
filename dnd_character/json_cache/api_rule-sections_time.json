{"name": "Time", "index": "time", "desc": "## Time\n\nIn situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers' movement happens on a scale of **minutes**. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.\n\nIn a city or wilderness, a scale of **hours** is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours' time.\n\nFor long journeys, a scale of **days** works best.\n\nFollowing the road from Baldur's Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.\n\nIn combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on **rounds**, a 6-second span of time.\n", "url": "/api/rule-sections/time"}
